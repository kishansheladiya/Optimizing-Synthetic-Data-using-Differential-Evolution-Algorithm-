# Optimizing Synthetic Data Using Differential Evolution Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script and a Jupyter Notebook for generating synthetic household data using random library,and optimized using a Differential Evolution Algorithm (DEA). 
In "num_person variable with comparision graph" file comparision between the proportion of optimal synthetic solution and empitrical data show.
## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python:** Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- **Jupyter Notebook (Optional):** Install Jupyter Notebook if you prefer to run the code interactively. Run the command:
  ```bash
  pip install jupyter

- Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries using the command:
bash

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

## Dataset
- Download the dataset 'Household_data.csv' and place it in the same directory as your Python script or Jupyter Notebook. Ensure that the dataset structure matches the code expectations.

## Running the Code

#Jupyter Notebook

1). Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Jupyter Notebook.

2). Run the command:

	jupyter notebook

3). Open the notebook file (your_notebook.ipynb) and execute each cell.

## Python Script
1). Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing your Python script.

2). Run the command:

python your_script.py

## Results

After running "num_person variable with comparision graph" file, the script/notebook will generate boxplots, which will be displayed in the output based on the code, and comparision bar graph between the proportion of optimal synthetic solution and empitrical data show.
After running the other all File, the script/notebook will generate boxplots, which will be displayed in the output based on the code.
